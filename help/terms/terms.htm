frequently encountered in foreign trade are: tariffs of the
international transportation companies operating on sea, on land, and
in the air; tariffs of the international cable, radio, and telephone
companies; and the customs tariffs of the various countries, which list
goods that are duty free and those subject to import duty, giving the
rate of duty in each case. There are various classes of customs duties </font></p>
      <p><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
 size="1"><strong>Title, Passing</strong></font><font
 face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
The passing of title to exported goods is determined in large measure
by the selling terms. For example, if an exporter sells goods c.i.f he
may be presumed to pass ownership and tender of documents. However, he
may ship on a bill of lading drawn to his own order, to prevent the
buyer from gaining possession of the goods until the draft is paid or
accepted. In this case he retains a security title to the goods; that
is, a title for security purposes only, until the financial arrangement
is carried out. Caution: depending on the laws of the buyer's country,
you may not be able to force passage of title without payment having
been received or the buyer having accepted delivery of the goods or a
clear understanding by the buyer being understood and accepted. </font></p>

Latin, "on first appearance." A term frequently encountered in foreign

acknowledges that the goods were received "in apparent good order and

evidence of the conditions of the containers; that is, if nothing to

The passing of title to exported goods is determined in large measure
by the selling terms. For example, if an exporter sells goods c.i.f he
may be presumed to pass ownership and tender of documents. However, he
may ship on a bill of lading drawn to his own order, to prevent the
buyer from gaining possession of the goods until the draft is paid or
accepted. In this case he retains a security title to the goods; that
is, a title for security purposes only, until the financial arrangement
is carried out. Caution: depending on the laws of the buyer's country,
you may not be able to force passage of title without payment having
been received or the buyer having accepted delivery of the goods or a
clear understanding by the buyer being understood and accepted. </font></p>

WORKS (EXW)</strong><br>
      <br>
Ex works means that the seller's only responsibility is to make the
goods available at his premises (that is, works or factory). In
particular, he is not responsible for loading the goods in a vehicle
provided by the buyer, unless otherwise agreed. The buyer bears the
full cost and risk involved in bringing the goods from there to the
desired destination. This term thus represents the minimum obligation
for the seller.<br>
      <br>
Apply only at the point of origin, and the seller agrees to place the
goods at the disposal of the buyer at the specified place on the date
or within the fixed period. All other charges are payable by the buyer.</font></p>
      <p><small><small><span style="font-family: Arial;">The
seller (exporter) makes the goods available to the buyer (importer) at
the seller's premises. The buyer is responsible for all transportation
costs, duties, and insurance, and accepts risk of loss of goods
immediately after the goods are purchased and placed outside the
factory door. The ExWorks price does not include the price of loading
goods onto a truck or vessel, and no allowance is made for clearing
customs. If FOB is the Customs valuation basis of the goods in the
country of destination, the transportation and insurance costs from the
seller's premises to the port of export must be added to the ExWorks
price. </span></small></small><br>

to the goods from that moment. It should be noted that, unlike FOB, the

"multimodal" transport as containers or RO/RO (roll on - roll off)

FOB except that the seller's obligations are fulfilled when the goods
are delivered into the custody of the carrier at the named point. If no
precise point can be mentioned at the time of the contract of sale, the
parties should refer to the place or range where the carrier should

Seller has goods available in country of import and bears all costs and

cleared for import. While EXW represents minimum obligation for the
seller, DDP represents the maximum obligation. If seller is unable to
obtain import license, DDU term should be used.<br>

      <p style="font-family: Arial;"><small><small>The
seller (exporter) is responsible for all costs
involved in delivering the goods to a named place of destination and
for clearing Customs in the country of import. Under a DDP Incoterm,
the seller provides literally door-to-door delivery, including Customs
clearance in the port of export and the port of destination. Thus the
seller bears the entire risk of loss until goods are delivered to the
buyer&rsquo;s premises. A DDP transaction will read &ldquo;DDP
named
place of destination&rdquo;. For example, assuming goods imported
through Baltimore are delivered to Silver Spring, the Incoterm would
read &ldquo;DDP, Silver Spring&rdquo;. If CIF is the Customs
valuation
basis, the costs of unloading the vessel, clearing Customs, and
delivery to the buyer&rsquo;s premises in the country of
destination
including inland insurance, must be
deducted to arrive at the CIF value.</small></small></p>
